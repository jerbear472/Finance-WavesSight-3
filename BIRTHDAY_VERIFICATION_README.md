# Birthday Verification Implementation

This document describes the implementation of birthday verification for user registration in WaveSight.

## Overview

Users must now enter their birthday during registration and confirm they are 18 years or older to create an account.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**File:** `supabase/add_birthday_field.sql`
- Added `birthday` column (DATE) to the `profiles` table
- Added `age_verified` column (BOOLEAN) to track age verification status
- Created `check_user_age()` function to verify users are 18+
- Created `calculate_age()` function to calculate user age
- Updated `handle_new_user()` function to process birthday data
- Added RLS policy to restrict trend creation to verified 18+ users
- Added constraints to ensure birthday validity

### 2. Web Application Updates

**File:** `web/app/register/page.tsx`
- Added birthday input field to the registration form
- Implemented client-side age verification (18+ check)
- Added validation for future dates and reasonable age ranges
- Updated form submission to include birthday data
- Added helpful UI messages about age requirements

**File:** `web/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Updated the `register` function interface to accept birthday parameter
- Modified user registration to pass birthday to Supabase auth metadata
- Updated profile creation to include birthday and age_verified fields

### 3. Mobile Application Updates

**File:** `mobile/src/screens/RegisterScreenWithBirthday.tsx`
- Created an updated registration screen with birthday picker
- Implemented native date picker for birthday selection
- Added age verification logic
- Updated the UI to match the web experience

## Database Migration

To apply the database changes, run:

```bash
node apply-birthday-field.js
```

Or execute the SQL directly in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Path: supabase/add_birthday_field.sql
```

## Implementation Details

### Age Calculation

The age verification uses a precise calculation that accounts for:
- Current year vs birth year
- Current month vs birth month
- Current day vs birth day

This ensures users are exactly 18 years or older, not just born 18+ years ago.

### Security Considerations

1. **Server-side Validation**: The database trigger validates age on the server side
2. **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security ensures only verified 18+ users can create trends
3. **Data Privacy**: Birthday is stored securely and only used for age verification

### User Experience

1. **Clear Messaging**: Users see "You must be 18 or older to create an account"
2. **Date Picker**: Easy-to-use date selection interface
3. **Validation Feedback**: Clear error messages if age requirement not met
4. **Future Date Prevention**: Users cannot select future dates

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Try registering with a birthday less than 18 years ago - should show error
2. Try registering with a birthday exactly 18 years ago - should succeed
3. Try registering with a future date - should show error
4. Verify that the birthday is saved correctly in the database
5. Confirm that age_verified flag is set appropriately

## Future Enhancements

1. Add birthday to user profile display (with privacy settings)
2. Implement age-gated content based on age_verified flag
3. Add birthday reminders/notifications feature
4. Consider COPPA compliance for users under 13 (currently blocked)
