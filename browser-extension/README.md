# WaveSight Browser Extension

## Why This Approach is TOS-Compliant

### ✅ User-Initiated Actions
- User manually navigates to posts
- User clicks "Capture" button
- No automated browsing or scraping
- Similar to manual copy/paste

### ❌ What We DON'T Do
- No automated login
- No bot behavior
- No mass scraping
- No bypassing rate limits
- No pretending to be human

## How It Works

1. **User browses normally** on Instagram, TikTok, etc.
2. **User sees interesting trend** and wants to save it
3. **User clicks extension** to capture visible data
4. **Data sent to WaveSight** for trend tracking

## Installation

1. Open Chrome/Edge
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select this `browser-extension` folder

## Legal Considerations

### Generally Acceptable ✅
- Capturing publicly visible data
- User-initiated actions
- Personal use / research
- No circumvention of protections

### Still Risky ⚠️
- Storing competitor data
- Commercial use of data
- Sharing scraped data
- High-volume usage

## Best Practices

1. **Rate Limit Yourself**: Don't capture 100s of posts/day
2. **Personal Use**: Use for trend research, not data harvesting
3. **Respect Privacy**: Don't capture private accounts
4. **Manual Process**: Keep it user-driven, not automated

## Alternative: Official APIs

For 100% compliance, use official APIs:
- Instagram Basic Display API
- TikTok Display API
- YouTube Data API v3
- Twitter API v2

These require:
- Application approval
- OAuth implementation
- Rate limits
- Often costs money

## The Safe Middle Ground

This extension represents a middle ground:
- More convenient than manual copy/paste
- Less risky than automated scraping
- User stays in control
- No bot behavior

Remember: Just because you CAN capture data doesn't mean you SHOULD do it at scale!
