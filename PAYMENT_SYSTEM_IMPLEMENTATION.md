# Payment System Implementation Guide

## What's Been Fixed

I've implemented a complete payment system for WaveSite with the following components:

### 1. Database Schema (✅ Complete)
Run the SQL script to create all necessary tables and functions:
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
/Users/JeremyUys_1/Desktop/WAVESITE2/fix-payment-system.sql
```

This creates:
- `cashout_requests` table for payment requests
- `payment_methods` table for future payment options
- Views and functions for balance calculations
- RLS policies for security

### 2. User Interface Updates

#### Enhanced Earnings Page
Replace the current earnings page with the enhanced version:
```bash
# Rename the enhanced file
mv web/app/(authenticated)/earnings/page-enhanced.tsx web/app/(authenticated)/earnings/page.tsx
```

This provides:
- Overview tab with earnings summary
- Transactions tab showing all earnings
- Payment History tab showing cashout requests

#### Payment History Component
Already created at: `web/components/PaymentHistory.tsx`

#### Admin Payment Processing
Admin interface at: `web/app/admin/payments/page.tsx`
- Accessible only to admins (checks for jeremyuys@gmail.com or is_admin flag)
- Shows all pending cashout requests
- Process payments with transaction IDs
- Export functionality

### 3. How It Works

#### For Users:
1. Users earn money by submitting trends and validating
2. When they have $10+ available, they can request a cashout
3. They enter their Venmo username and submit
4. They can track status in Payment History tab

#### For Admins:
1. Go to `/admin/payments` to see pending requests
2. Click "Process" on a request
3. Send money via Venmo manually
4. Enter the Venmo transaction ID
5. Mark as completed or failed

### 4. Testing the System

```sql
-- Check if everything was created
SELECT * FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'cashout_requests';
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'cashout_requests';

-- Test creating a cashout request (as a user)
SELECT validate_cashout_request(auth.uid(), 25.00);

-- View pending requests (as admin)
SELECT * FROM admin_cashout_queue;
```

### 5. Security Features

- **Minimum cashout**: $10
- **One request at a time**: Users can't create multiple pending requests
- **Balance validation**: Can't request more than available balance
- **Admin-only processing**: Only admins can mark payments as complete
- **Audit trail**: All actions are logged with timestamps

### 6. Next Steps

#### Email Notifications (Not implemented yet)
To add email notifications, you'll need to:
1. Set up Supabase email templates
2. Add triggers to send emails on status changes
3. Configure SMTP settings in Supabase

#### Automated Payments (Future enhancement)
Consider integrating:
- Venmo API (currently limited access)
- PayPal API for automated payouts
- Stripe Connect for direct deposits

### 7. Admin Access

To give someone admin access:
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET is_admin = true 
WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

### 8. Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "You already have a pending cashout request"
**Solution**: Admin needs to process or cancel the existing request

**Issue**: "Insufficient balance"
**Solution**: User needs to wait for more earnings or pending earnings to be approved

**Issue**: Can't access admin panel
**Solution**: Make sure user email is 'jeremyuys@gmail.com' or has is_admin = true

### 9. Monitoring

```sql
-- View payment statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_requests,
  SUM(amount) as total_amount,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'pending') as pending_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed_count
FROM cashout_requests;

-- Check user balances
SELECT * FROM user_payment_summary ORDER BY available_balance DESC;
```

## Summary

The payment system is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Database tables and functions
- ✅ User cashout requests
- ✅ Payment history tracking
- ✅ Admin processing interface
- ✅ Balance validation
- ✅ Security policies

Users can now request cashouts and admins can process them. The only manual step is actually sending the money via Venmo, which the admin does before marking the request as completed.
