# Timeline Creator Links Update

## âœ… What's Been Added

### 1. Clickable Creator Handles in Timeline
- Creator handles are now **clickable links** that open the creator's profile on their platform
- Works in all 3 view modes: Grid, List, and Timeline
- Links open in new tabs with proper security attributes

### 2. Platform-Specific Profile URLs
The system automatically generates the correct profile URL based on the platform:
- **TikTok**: `https://www.tiktok.com/@username`
- **Instagram**: `https://www.instagram.com/username`
- **YouTube**: `https://www.youtube.com/@username`
- **Twitter/X**: `https://x.com/username`

### 3. Automatic Creator Handle Extraction
When submitting a trend, the system automatically extracts creator handles from URLs:

#### TikTok
- From URL: `https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/123`
- Extracts: `@username`
- Also uses TikTok's oEmbed API for enhanced metadata

#### Instagram
- From URL: `https://www.instagram.com/username/p/postid`
- Extracts: `@username`
- Also uses Instagram's oEmbed API for enhanced metadata

#### YouTube
- From URL: `https://www.youtube.com/@channelname/video`
- Extracts: `@channelname`
- Also uses YouTube's oEmbed API for enhanced metadata

#### Twitter/X
- From URL: `https://twitter.com/username/status/123`
- Extracts: `@username`
- Also uses Twitter's oEmbed API for enhanced metadata
