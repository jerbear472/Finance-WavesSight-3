# Trend Submission Fix

## Problem
The trend submission flow was experiencing issues with:
1. Missing database columns causing submission failures
2. Metadata not being properly captured and stored
3. Insufficient error handling and retry logic
4. Post data (creator handle, caption, dates) not being saved

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Submission Handlers
Updated both `/timeline` and `/submit` page handlers with:
- **Better error handling** - Specific error messages for different failure types
- **Retry logic with exponential backoff** - 3 retries with increasing delays
- **Comprehensive logging** - Console logs at each step for debugging
- **Default values** - Ensures required fields always have values
- **Conditional field insertion** - Only adds optional fields if they have values

### 2. Database Schema Updates
Created `ensure_all_columns.sql` to add any missing columns:
- Social media metadata fields (creator_handle, post_caption, etc.)
- Engagement metrics (likes_count, comments_count, shares_count, views_count)
- Post metadata (hashtags, post_url, thumbnail_url, posted_at)
- Quality score (quality_score only - wave_score is calculated by the system later)
- Proper indexes for performance
- RLS policies for security

### 3. Form Component Updates
Enhanced `TrendSubmissionForm` to:
- Include all metadata fields in the interface
- Pass thumbnail_url and posted_at from extraction
- Add logging for debugging
- Properly handle all extracted data

### 4. Metadata Extraction
The `MetadataExtractor` already captures:
- Creator handles from URLs
- Post captions (separated from hashtags for TikTok)
- Engagement metrics when available
- Post dates (estimated for TikTok based on video ID)
- Thumbnails from oEmbed APIs

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Run the SQL script** in your Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of ensure_all_columns.sql
   ```

2. **Test the submission flow**:
   - Try submitting a trend with a TikTok/Instagram URL
   - Check console logs for any errors
   - Verify all metadata is captured and displayed

3. **What gets saved**:
   - Basic info: URL, title, category, platform
   - Creator info: handle, name
   - Post data: caption, hashtags, posted date
   - Engagement: likes, comments, shares, views
   - Media: thumbnail URL, uploaded images

## Features

### Auto-capture from URLs
When you paste a social media URL, the system automatically:
- Detects the platform
- Extracts creator handle
- Gets post caption
- Captures engagement metrics
- Estimates post date
- Downloads thumbnail

### Robust submission
- Retries failed submissions up to 3 times
- Provides clear error messages
- Saves drafts automatically
- Works even with partial data

### Complete data storage
All extracted metadata is now properly stored in the database and displayed in:
- Timeline view (all 3 modes)
- Recent submissions on submit page
- Trend details

## Troubleshooting

If submissions still fail:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Ensure you're logged in (authentication errors)
3. Verify the URL is from a supported platform
4. Check that required fields (URL, title, category) are filled

The system now logs detailed information at each step to help identify any remaining issues.
