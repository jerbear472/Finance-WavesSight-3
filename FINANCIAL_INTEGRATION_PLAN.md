# Financial Intelligence Integration Plan for WAVESITE2

## Overview
This plan outlines the integration of hedge fund-focused financial data extraction capabilities into the existing WAVESITE2 trend detection platform.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Extension (Week 1)

### 1.1 Core Financial Tables
- [ ] Add financial columns to existing `trend_submissions` table
- [ ] Create `financial_signals` table for extracted intelligence
- [ ] Create `stock_signals` table for individual stock alerts
- [ ] Create `hedge_fund_alerts` table for client notifications
- [ ] Create `brand_database` table for entity recognition
- [ ] Create `hedge_fund_clients` table for client management
- [ ] Create `signal_performance` table for tracking accuracy

### 1.2 Database Migration
```bash
# Location: /supabase/migrations/
- 20250729_add_financial_intelligence_schema.sql
- 20250729_add_hedge_fund_client_tables.sql
- 20250729_create_financial_views_and_functions.sql
```

## Phase 2: Backend Integration (Week 1-2)

### 2.1 Financial Extraction Service
- [ ] Port `FinancialIntelligenceExtractor` class to TypeScript
- [ ] Integrate with existing trend submission flow
- [ ] Add to `/backend/app/services/financial_extractor.py`
- [ ] Create brand entity recognition service
- [ ] Implement real-time signal generation

### 2.2 API Endpoints
- [ ] Create new router: `/backend/app/api/v1/hedge_fund.py`
- [ ] Implement endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/hedge-fund/trending-stocks`
  - `GET /api/v1/hedge-fund/live-alerts`
  - `GET /api/v1/hedge-fund/stocks/{ticker}/analysis`
  - `GET /api/v1/hedge-fund/sectors/momentum`
  - `GET /api/v1/hedge-fund/trends/{id}/performance`
  - `POST /api/v1/hedge-fund/webhooks`

### 2.3 Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Modify trend submission flow to include financial extraction
- [ ] Add background job for signal processing
- [ ] Implement alert generation logic
- [ ] Create performance tracking system

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (Week 2-3)

### 3.1 Hedge Fund Dashboard
- [ ] Create `/web/app/hedge-fund/dashboard/page.tsx`
- [ ] Build components:
  - `TrendingStocksWidget`
  - `LiveAlertsFeed`
  - `SectorMomentumChart`
  - `SignalPerformanceTracker`
  - `FinancialRelevanceScore`

### 3.2 Enhanced Enterprise Features
- [ ] Add financial view toggle to enterprise dashboard
- [ ] Create stock signal cards with:
  - Ticker, company name, sector
  - Signal strength and urgency
  - Investment timing recommendations
  - Risk factors and catalysts

### 3.3 Real-time Features
- [ ] WebSocket connection for live alerts
- [ ] Push notifications for critical signals
- [ ] Auto-updating trending stocks list

## Phase 4: Authentication & Access Control (Week 3)

### 4.1 Hedge Fund Client Management
- [ ] Create client onboarding flow
- [ ] Implement API key generation
- [ ] Add subscription tier management
- [ ] Build usage tracking system

### 4.2 Access Control
- [ ] Add `hedge_fund` user type to auth system
- [ ] Implement tiered rate limiting
- [ ] Create billing integration
- [ ] Add usage analytics

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 4)

### 5.1 Machine Learning Integration
- [ ] Train brand recognition model
- [ ] Implement sentiment analysis enhancement
- [ ] Create signal accuracy predictor
- [ ] Build trend-to-stock correlation engine

### 5.2 Performance Analytics
- [ ] Historical backtesting system
- [ ] Signal accuracy tracking
- [ ] ROI calculation per signal
- [ ] Client performance dashboards

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User submits trend → 
2. Original validation flow continues → 
3. Financial extractor processes in parallel → 
4. Signals generated and stored → 
5. Alerts sent to subscribed hedge funds → 
6. Performance tracked over time

### Key Integration Points
- Trend submission handler: Add financial extraction
- Validation completion: Trigger signal generation
- Enterprise dashboard: Add financial view mode
- API layer: New hedge fund endpoints
- WebSocket server: Real-time alert delivery
