2. Click on "Email" provider
3. **Disable** "Confirm email" 
4. Save changes

### Option 2: Create User Manually

2. Click "Create user"
3. Create a user with:
   - Email: `demo@wavesight.com`
   - Password: `DemoUser123!`

### Option 3: Use Realistic Email
Try registering with realistic-looking emails:
- `john.doe@gmail.com`
- `test.user@company.com`

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Fix authentication** using one of the options above

## 🔧 Optional: Backend API Setup

If you need the backend API later:

```bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## 📱 Mobile App

The React Native mobile app is in the `mobile/` directory but requires additional setup with Xcode/Android Studio.
